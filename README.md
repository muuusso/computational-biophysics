# Simulation and trajectory analysis of 8DD9 mutation of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) main protease

The [8DD9](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8DD9) mutation and the [6WTT](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6WTT) wild type protein of the SARS-Cov-2
main protease were simulated with the open source software [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/) and analyzed with the python packet 
[MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/). 

Here are reported some of the notebooks of analysis and the final report of the project. Simulation data are not uploaded due to their size.
